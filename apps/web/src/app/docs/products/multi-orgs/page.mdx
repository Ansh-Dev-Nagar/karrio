Every Karrio project comes with multi-organization capabilities when using Karrio Insiders, providing tenant isolation, organization-based resource management, team collaboration tools, and hierarchical access control for enterprise deployments.

## Features

### Organization-Based Resource Management

You don't have to manage resources individually. Our multi-organization system provides shared ownership of carrier connections, shipments, tracking, and other resources within organizational boundaries.

## Organization Roles

### Role Hierarchy

Organizations support a hierarchical role system with different permission levels:

#### Admin

- **Full Organization Control**: Manage organization settings, billing, and deletion
- **User Management**: Invite, remove, and change roles for all users
- **Resource Management**: Full access to all organization resources
- **Ownership Transfer**: Can transfer organization ownership

#### Manager

- **User Management**: Invite users and manage roles (except admin)
- **Resource Management**: Create, read, update, and delete organization resources
- **Team Oversight**: Monitor team activities and resource usage
- **Limited Settings**: Access to operational settings only

#### User

- **Resource Access**: Create and manage their own resources within the organization
- **Shared Resources**: Access to shared organization resources based on permissions
- **Collaboration**: Participate in team workflows and processes
- **Read Access**: View organization information and team member lists

#### Viewer

- **Read-Only Access**: View all organization resources and activities
- **No Modification**: Cannot create, update, or delete any resources
- **Reporting**: Access to reports and analytics
- **Limited Interaction**: Can only view and export data

## Resource Sharing

### Shared Resources

Organizations automatically share the following resources among members:

#### Carrier Connections

- **Shared Access**: All organization members can use configured carriers
- **Centralized Management**: Admins and managers control carrier configurations
- **Cost Optimization**: Shared carrier accounts reduce setup overhead

#### Shipments

- **Visibility**: Organization members can view relevant shipments based on permissions
- **Collaboration**: Multiple users can work on the same shipment workflows
- **Tracking**: Shared tracking access for customer service teams

#### Documents

- **Template Sharing**: Organization-wide document templates and branding
- **Storage Access**: Shared document storage and retrieval
- **Brand Consistency**: Unified branding across all generated documents

### Resource Isolation

Each organization maintains strict resource isolation:

```javascript
// Resources are automatically filtered by organization context
// Organization switching is handled through the web interface
// API calls automatically use the active organization's context

// Use organization-specific API keys for automated processes
```

## Use Cases

### Multi-Tenant SaaS Platforms

Perfect for SaaS platforms serving multiple clients:

- **Client Isolation**: Each client gets their own organization with isolated resources
- **White-Label Branding**: Custom branding per organization
- **Usage Tracking**: Per-organization billing and usage monitoring
- **Scalability**: Easy onboarding of new clients as organizations

### Enterprise Departments

Ideal for large enterprises with multiple departments:

- **Department Separation**: Each department manages its own shipping operations
- **Cross-Department Collaboration**: Users can participate in multiple departments
- **Centralized Oversight**: Enterprise-wide visibility for executives
- **Budget Management**: Department-level cost tracking and budgeting

### Partner Ecosystems

Enable partner and vendor collaboration:

- **Partner Organizations**: Create organizations for external partners
- **Limited Access**: Provide specific access to relevant resources only
- **Collaboration Workflows**: Enable joint shipping operations
- **Audit Trails**: Track partner activities and resource usage

### Franchise Management

Support franchise business models:

- **Franchise Organizations**: Each franchise location gets its own organization
- **Brand Consistency**: Shared branding and templates across franchises
- **Centralized Support**: Headquarters can assist franchise operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance across all franchise locations

## Integration Examples

### Organization Switching

```javascript
// Organization switching is handled through the web interface
// Each organization has its own dedicated workspace and API keys
// Users can access multiple organizations through the dashboard

// For API integrations, use organization-specific API keys
const getOrganizationData = async (orgApiKey) => {
  const client = new KarrioClient({ apiKey: orgApiKey });
  const shipments = await client.shipments.list();
  const carriers = await client.carriers.list();

  return { shipments, carriers };
};
```

### Team Invitation Workflow

```javascript
// Team invitations are handled through the admin dashboard
// Admins can invite users via the web interface
// Invitation emails are sent automatically with secure links

// Users accept invitations by following the email link
// This creates their account and grants access to the organization
```

### Role Management

```javascript
// User role management is handled through the admin dashboard
// Admins can update user roles and permission groups
// Role changes take effect immediately for the user's session

// Available roles: owner, admin, developer, member
// Permission groups can be customized per user as needed
```

## Best Practices

### Organization Structure

#### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive, meaningful organization names
- Include department or team identifiers
- Consider using consistent naming patterns

#### Role Assignment

- Start with minimal permissions and expand as needed
- Regular review of user roles and permissions
- Document role responsibilities and expectations

#### Resource Management

- Establish clear ownership of shared resources
- Regular cleanup of unused carrier connections
- Monitor resource usage and costs per organization

### Security Considerations

#### Access Control

- Implement least-privilege access principles
- Regular audit of user permissions
- Monitor cross-organization access patterns

#### Data Isolation

- Verify organization-based data filtering
- Test resource isolation boundaries
- Implement proper error handling for unauthorized access

## Getting Started

Ready to implement multi-organization support in your application? Follow these steps:

1. **Create your first organization** and invite team members
2. **Set up role-based access control** for different user types
3. **Configure resource sharing** based on your business needs
4. **Implement organization switching** in your user interface

### Next Steps

- Learn about [user management](/docs/products/user-management) for detailed user administration
